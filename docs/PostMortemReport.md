Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.

# Best things
The use of spring framework accelerates the process of development of the project and with the aid from JPA it simplifies the interaction with the database and manipulation of the tables and their fields. The three layer mvc pattern is easy to understand and it was a good choice for the project. The well structured documents also helped the development process and enhanced the division of the work equally with development team. Moreover, the CATME tool was useful for creating teams so that teams are balanced and everyone could have the oppurtunity to improve their soft skills.

# Worst things
There was not a unique tool for the students to receive information related to the development process of the application and acquiring information about further changes. The students had to check multiple places to know about this information and often the inconsistent answers were given to the question by professors. The constraints to not change some parts of the project and waiting for fixes of the materials slowed down the project development and it caused the wrong estimation of time. Moreover, doing the tests on the entities and the repositories were a little confusing and meaningless. 

# Suggestions 
Considering a unique tool for interaction between the developers of the project and managing the documents before starting the development and also give the developers freedom to change and fix the parts that causes bugs which were not under their control. Moreover, instead of working on black-box and white-box tests it would more useful to focus on integration tests so that the functionality of the application goes under the real test and lead to the desired result.
